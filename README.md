| Project| Description | Libraries used|
| :------ | :--------- | :-------- |
|[Machine Learning Model For Client Churn Prediction](https://github.com/etsar/my-DA-and-DS-projects/tree/main/client_churn_prediction_for_telecom_operator)| We trained the Machine Learning model to predict client churn of the telecom operator.|CatBoost, Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, Phi_K, re, Seaborn, scikit-learn, time|
|[Game Platforms Analysis](https://github.com/etsar/my-DA-and-DS-projects/tree/main/game_platforms_analysis)| We identified patterns that form the success of the game, using historical data on video games sales, user's and expert's reviews, genres and platforms.|Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, SciPy, Seaborn|
|[Telecom Plan Analysis](https://github.com/etsar/my-DA-and-DS-projects/tree/main/choosing_best_plan_for_telecom_company)| We analyzed the client's behavior and determined which prepaid plan of the telecom operator "Megaline" brings in more revenue.|Matplotlib, NumPy, pandas, SciPy|
